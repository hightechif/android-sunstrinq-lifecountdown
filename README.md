## 💭 Philosophy

*"Memento mori"* - Remember that you will die

This app is inspired by the ancient Stoic practice of contemplating mortality, not to be morbid, but to:
- Gain clarity on what matters most
- Reduce anxiety about trivial concerns
- Increase gratitude for life
- Motivate meaningful action
